# Sermon Companion Frontend

This repository contains the frontend portion of the **Sermon Companion** application built with Ionic and Angular. The goal is to help preachers, Bible teachers, and lay believers quickly generate sermon outlines using OpenAI while allowing full customization and offline access.

## Features

- Generate sermon outlines from a topic or scripture reference
- Choose preferred Bible translations
- Edit content in a rich-text editor and add personal notes
- Optional voice commands for hands-free creation
- Save sermons for offline use and share them with church groups
- Suggested closing prayers to include or modify

## Development

The project is in early stages. To get started:

1. Ensure you have Node.js (v18+) and the Ionic CLI installed.
2. Clone the repository and run `npm install`.
3. Use `ionic serve` during development.
4. Refer to **TODO.md** for upcoming tasks aimed at making the app production ready.
